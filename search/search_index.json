Here are our rules: They should be shorter than 300 lines of code (comments may be as long as you want). They should demonstrate modern Keras / TensorFlow 2.0 best practices. They should be substantially different in topic from all examples listed above. They should be extensively documented & commented. New examples are added via Pull Requests to the https://github.com/Jhansi-27/Sample_Auto repository. They must be submitted as a .py file that follows a specific format. They are usually generated from Jupyter notebooks.","title":"Code Examples"},{"location":"howto/","text":"How to get AutoNeuro?

The outcome or target variable is dichotomous in nature. Dichotomous means there are only two possible classes. For example, it can be used for cancer detection problems.
